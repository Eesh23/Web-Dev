Git Usage Instructions for Project Management

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Begin by cloning the "MyProject" repository to your local machine using the command:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MyProject.git
     ```

2. **Create a New Branch:**
   - After cloning, create a new branch for your work to keep changes separate from the main branch. Use:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b feature-branch
     ```
   - Replace "feature-branch" with a descriptive name for your branch.

3. **Write Some Code:**
   - On your feature branch, start writing and modifying code as required for your project.

4. **Commit Your Changes:**
   - Commit changes to your local repository after modifications. Use:
     ```bash
     git add .                 # Add all changes to the staging area
     git commit -m "Your message here"  # Commit changes with a descriptive message
     ```

5. **Pull Latest Main Branch:**
   - Keep your feature branch updated with the main branch. Before merging, pull the latest updates:
     ```bash
     git checkout main         # Switch to the main branch
     git pull origin main      # Pull the latest changes from the remote main branch
     ```

6. **Merge Your Branch with Main:**
   - Merge your feature branch into the main branch using:
     ```bash
     git checkout feature-branch  # Switch back to your feature branch
     git merge main               # Merge main into your feature branch
     ```
   - Resolve any conflicts during the merge.

7. **Push to GitHub:**
   - Push your feature branch to GitHub with:
     ```bash
     git push origin feature-branch  # Push your feature branch to the remote repository
     ```
   - Create a pull request on GitHub to merge your changes into the main branch.
